        <h1>Andrea Perez</h1>
        <em>English Teacher and Amateur Web developer </em>
        <br>
        I am an English teacher aiming to switch careers and become a Web Developer. I speak English, Spanish and a bit of French. I love creating, designing, and using my imagination to simplify and beautify. I know  <strong>HTML, CSS</strong> and am currently learning <strong>JavaScript</strong>. I like being challeged, learning new skills, being a team player and being out of my comfort-zone to become a better version of myself.
